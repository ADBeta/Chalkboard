# Chalkboard
### (c) ADBeta 2022
## Description
Chalkboard is a GUI based TODO list with some nice extra functionality. Designed  
to sit in the backround most of the time to help with reminders, projects,  
deadlines etc.

It uses XML formatted files, with an emphasis on rich text support and UI design  

** This is a hobby projects, as such it takes a long time to finish or add  
featrues. Any comments or input is appriciated **  

Notes: TeFiEd is used to open, read and write the file, while RapidXML is used  
to parse and handle XML DOMs, however it cannot handle the files itself.  
As such, this project will not be truely complete until I impiment my own XML  
parser, with file managment - Consider all versions until this change takes place  
to be a beta build.  

## Dependancies
* TeFiEd (Contained in include. See my github for more info)  
* RapidXML (Contained in the include dir. No user download required)  

## TO-DO 

## Longterm TO-DO
* Create my own XML parser that can handle files directly and can output into  
the parent file.  

## Changelog
* 0.0.1 - Initial base design.

Chalkboard is under the GPL (GPL3.0), please see LICENCE for information
